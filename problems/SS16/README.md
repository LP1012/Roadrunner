# Stainless Steel 16 Irradiated with 3 MeV Protons

This problem looks to simulate the results obtained by an irradiation experiment conducted at the University of Michigan.
Stainless Steel 16 compositions for SRIM are thus:
 - Ni: 12.00
 - Cr: 17.00
 - Mo:  2.50
 - Fe: Balance
 - Si:  1.00
 - Mn:  2.00
 -  C:  0.080
 -  P:  0.045
 -  S:  0.030
