# Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>
This directory contains the data and simulations done for Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>. 
Two cases were considered:
1. Pure
2. Carbon-doped
The reasoning for this is discussed in ***In situ* investigation of ion irradiation-induced amorphization of (Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>)<sub>1-x</sub>C<sub>x</sub> [$0 \leq x \leq 0.12$].**
For all samples simulated, 90 nm (900 Ang) film was used.
