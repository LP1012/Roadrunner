# Problem Specifications
A pure sample of Ge~2~Sb~2~Te~5~ was simluated in SRIM to approximate the heating in the material exposed to 2.8 MeV gold ions.
Atom density was taken from the paper to be $4.086\times 10^{22}$ atoms/cc.
This gave an approximate density of 69.67 g/cc for the cubic configuration and 57.54 g/cc for the trigonal configuration.
