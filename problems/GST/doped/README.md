# Problem Specifications

The doped case considers an atom fraction $x=0.1$ for doping of carbon.
(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>)<sub>0.9</sub>C<sub>0.1</sub>
A number density of $4.086\times10^{22}$ was used to approximate the density, giving a value of 62.72 g/cc.
This density was used in SRIM's calculations, where 2.8 MeV gold ions were simulated striking the target.
As in the paper, the thickness of the film was taken to be 90 nm, or 900 Ang.
