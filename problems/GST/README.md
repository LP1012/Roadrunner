# Ge~2~Sb~2~Te~5~
This directory contains the data and simulations done for Ge~2~Sb~2~Te~5~. 
Two cases were considered:
1. Pure
2. Carbon-doped
The reasoning for this is discussed in **In siture investigation of ion irradiation-induced amorphization of (Ge~2~Sb~2~Te~5~)~1-x~C~x [0$\leq$x$\leq$0.12]**.
For all samples simulated, 90 nm (900 Ang) film was used.
